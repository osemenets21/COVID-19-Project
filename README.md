Amidst the ongoing global pandemic, this project delves into the statistics of virus infections, vaccinations, and fatalities. By meticulously collecting and analyzing data using SQL and Tableau, it aims to provide valuable insights into the pandemic's dynamics and the efficacy of public health measures. Through rigorous analysis and visualization, this project contributes to informed decision-making in public health policy and intervention strategies. Sharing the findings on GitHub fosters collaboration and knowledge exchange among data analysts and public health professionals, advancing our collective efforts to combat infectious diseases and promote global health.

## Completed actions:

## Step 1: Data Collection
To start my analytical work, I turned to reliable data sources to obtain information on virus infections, vaccinations, and deaths. I used data from official medical organization websites and available open datasets.

## Step 2: Data Cleansing Using SQL
After obtaining the necessary data, I conducted the cleansing process using SQL. This step helped remove unnecessary or incorrect information, as well as merge different data sources for further analysis.

## Step 3: Data Visualization in Tableau
The cleansed data was imported into Tableau for creating visual representations. Through various charts, diagrams, and other visual elements, I analyzed trends and relationships between infections, vaccinations, and deaths.

## Step 4: Analysis and Conclusions
Based on the data visualization, I conducted an analysis and drew some conclusions regarding the dynamics of infections, vaccination effectiveness, and other important aspects. In this step, I identified key trends and patterns that helped make informed conclusions.

## Step 5: Publishing on GitHub
Finally, the results of my analytical project were published on GitHub for public access and knowledge sharing. This will allow other data analysis professionals to review my work and potentially use it for their research or projects.
